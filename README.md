## Coming Soon Webpage with Countdown

This is a simple "Coming Soon" webpage designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage displays a countdown timer to a specified date, along with a background image. The layout is created using the Bulma CSS framework to make it visually appealing and responsive.

### Features

- Full-height Hero section with a background image to create an attractive landing page.
- Countdown timer to a specified date, showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- The countdown automatically updates every second until the specified date.
- Once the countdown reaches the specified date, a "Website is currently being updated" message is displayed.

### Setup and Usage

1. Clone or download the `index.html` file to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file using a web browser.

3. Customize the webpage as per your needs:

   - Modify the `background` CSS property in the `<style>` tag to change the background image. Replace the URL inside `url('...')` with the path to your desired background image.
   - Update the `countDownDate` JavaScript variable to set the desired date and time for the countdown. The format should be `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"`, e.g., `"2020-09-15T15:30:00"`. By default, it's set to a random date in 2023, so make sure to change it to a date in 2020 for the countdown to work as intended.

4. Save the changes and refresh the webpage to see the updated coming soon page.

### Note

- The webpage uses the Bulma CSS framework for styling. You can customize the styles further by modifying the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.

- The webpage is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

- Remember to update the `countDownDate` variable to a date in 2020 for the countdown to work correctly.
